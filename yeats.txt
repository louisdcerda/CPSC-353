             “The Stolen Child”
Where dips the rocky highland
Of Sleuth Wood to the lake,
There lies a leafy island 
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy river rats; 
There we keep our fairy vats,
Full of berrys
And of reddest stolen cherries. 

Come away O human child!
To the waters and wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand
(it goes on like this, for another hundred lines or so)
		       –W.B. Yeats  (1865-1939)
